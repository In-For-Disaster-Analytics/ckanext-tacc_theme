# ckanext-tacc_theme 

DEPRECATED

```
In this pull request, I propose keeping the theme code in the current repository for now, as it was previously located here:
https://github.com/In-For-Disaster-Analytics/ckanext-tacc_theme.

Given the current situation, maintaining the code in the same place seems more practical at this time.

Changes:

Kept the theme code in the current repository rather than moving it.
Rationale:

This approach avoids unnecessary changes and simplifies the workflow for the moment.
Next Steps:

Review the proposed changes and confirm if this approach works, or if any modifications are needed.
